<ins>About me:</ins>

Hello! My name is Dmitry, and I am a passionate programmer. I have a strong background in software development and expertise in Python, Unity, and C#. I am experienced in object-oriented programming (OOP) and design patterns. I constantly strive to expand my knowledge and 
skills by working on various projects, including open-source game development and collaborating on a product aggregator for manufacturing.

I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and dedicated to delivering high-quality software solutions. I enjoy working in collaborative environments, tackling challenges, and finding innovative solutions.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, feel free to reach out to me. I am excited about new opportunities to contribute my skills and expertise to meaningful projects.
